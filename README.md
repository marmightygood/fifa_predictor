# Fifa World Cup 2018 Predictor

Run model_builder.py to generate an untuned DNN.

Run predictor.py to use the model created above to predict fifa results. Output is to output/predictions.csv

grid_search.py helps tune the model by training it using a series of hyperparameters.

Note this never actually achieved any significant predictive power - I'm keeping it around in case I come back to it.
